Machine learning nowadays
10 companies who use Machine Learning
Pinterest: Today, machine learning touches pretty much every aspect of Pinterest’s business operations. They use machine learning for spam moderation, content discovery, advertising, monetization and reducing churn of email newsletter subscribers. 
FaceBook: FaceBook uses machine learning for displaying the right content to their users, they use it for advertising, filtering out bad content and spam.
Google: Google says they are now rechearing all aspects of machine learning which is quite exciting because we can expect some cool algorithms and programs in the future. 
Google's section called Deepmind also developed a cool program called AlphaGo Zero. AlphaGo Zero is a program created to learn from its mistakes, for example it learned to play go (an easier type of checkers) in 3 days! The total costs for this program were $ 25.000.000. The total amount of hardware for this project was 1920 CPUs and 280 GPUs (which is quite a lot). Eventually AlphaGo’s software was so advanced due the training that it could win 100-0 against pretty much everyone. There was one person who could beat this program, Lee Se-dol is the human to ever beat this machine at its peak. Lee lost four times but won only once. Still this one win was very impressive due the amount of training this highly intelligent machine went through.
