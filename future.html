Future 
The global market of machine learning is predicted to continue to grow from 8,43 billion dollars (2019) to 117,19 billion dollars (2027). That’s because with machine  learning companies can make more accurate predictions and business decisions. Quantum machine learning can improve the analysis of data and obtain more profound insights. Google’s quantum processor in 2019  performed a task that normally would take 10.000 years according to google. That would be the amount of time it took with the world's fastest computer, but google's quantum processor did it in 200 seconds!
