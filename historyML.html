History
A computer program was made in the 1950 for playing checkers. It was made by Arthur Samuel of IBM. The only problem he had was his program had a very small amount of memory available Samuel initiated what is called alpha-beta pruning. His design included a scoring function using the positions of the pieces on the board. The scoring function attempted to measure the chances of each side winning. The program chooses its next move using a minimax strategy, which eventually evolved into the minimax algorithm. Other than that Samuel also designed a couple of mechanisms allowing his program to become better. What Samuel called rote learning, his program recorded/remembered all positions it had already seen and combined this with the values of the reward function. Arthur Samuel first came up with the phrase “Machine Learning” in 1952.
